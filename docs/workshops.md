# Workshops  

Welcome to the **Workshops** section! Here, you’ll find an overview of the hands-on training sessions I’ve taught, designed to empower participants with practical skills in bioinformatics and data analysis.  

## Past Workshops  

### RNA-Seq Data Analysis in R: From Raw Counts to Differential Expression  

**Date:** Nov 12th 2024 

**Description:** This workshop provided an introduction to RNA-seq analysis, covering everything from preprocessing raw sequencing data to identifying differentially expressed genes. Participants explored normalization, model fitting, and hypothesis testing in R, gaining the confidence to analyze their own datasets independently.

### Downstream Analysis of RNA-Seq Results in R: GSEA, PPI Networks, and Biological Interpretation  

**Date:** Nov 19th 2024

**Description:** Focused on the biological interpretation of RNA-seq results, this session delved into Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks, and leveraging R for uncovering meaningful insights from RNA-seq data.
