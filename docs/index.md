## About me
Hello! I'm a Biomedical Engineer and researcher at the [Center for Innovation in Brain Science](https://cibs.uahs.arizona.edu/), where my work focuses on leveraging computational methods to identify precision therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease prevention and treatment. I am currently working with [Dr. Francesca Vitali](https://deptmedicine.arizona.edu/profile/francesca-vitali-phd) under the mentorship of [Dr. Brinton](https://healthsciences.arizona.edu/about/executive-leadership/roberta-diaz-brinton-phd).

I'm passionate about exploring the power of AI for real-world clinical data analysis, driven by a deep curiosity about the potential of technology to revolutionize healthcare. I'm incredibly excited about the intersection of AI and biomedicine, constantly exploring innovative approaches to advance our understanding and treatment of neurological disorders.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow AI enthusiasts, researchers, and scientists alike.
