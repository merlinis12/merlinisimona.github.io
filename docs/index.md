## About me

Simona is a Ph.D student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arizona. She is currently working with [Dr. Francesca Vitali](https://deptmedicine.arizona.edu/profile/francesca-vitali-phd) under the mentorship of [Dr. Brinton](https://healthsciences.arizona.edu/about/executive-leadership/roberta-diaz-brinton-phd) in the Center for Innovation in Brain Science ([CIBS](https://cibs.uahs.arizona.edu/)). She earned her Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Pavia, Italy. Her research focuses on the computational identification of precision therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment. The broader aim of her research involved the development of precision medicine approach based on machine learning to identify therapies that treat the specific patient profiles/subpopulations using different sources of electronic medical records. She is interested in analyzing extensive real-world clinical data and performing meta-analysis across different datasets. She is also enthusiastic about incorporating patient-inspired and data-driven approaches in her research.
